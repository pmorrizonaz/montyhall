Description: The functions in this package allow the user to run simulations
    of the Monty Hall game. In the game, there are three doors, behind one
    of which is a car, and the other two are goats. The user randomly selects
    a door to start. Then, one of the doors with a goat is revealed, leaving
    two remaining unopened doors. The user can then stay with their initial
    door choice or change to the other unopened door. Based on this choice, it
    is then revealed if the user won or lost. There is an additional function
    that allows the user to simulate the game any number of times to determine
    the best strategy for the game.
